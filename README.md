<h2>About me</h2>
I am a dedicated and curious student with a strong passion for both technology and programming.

I am studying Computer Science â€“ Design and Development of IT Systems at Ã˜stfold University College and aim to complete my bachelor's degree in the summer of 2026 (if all goes according to plan ðŸ¤ž).

When I'm not deeply immersed in code, I work as a sales advisor at ElkjÃ¸p, where I not only help people find the right technology but also refine my social skills (and no, Iâ€™m not always trying to sell you the most expensive optionâ€¦ maybe).

In my free time, I try to learn Vue and Quasar or stay social in every possible wayâ€”whether it's attending events, gaming with friends, or meeting up in other ways.

Always open to exciting conversations, so don't hesitate to reach out!
